#TODO order:
    # First of all, make everything for a simple neuron/feature.

    #TODO generate dynamics
        # Spring
        # Lorentz
        # Izhikevich

    #TODO produce poisson based on dynamics
        # Don't mix dynamics (at first)
        # 1. Each neuron with independent dynamics

    # Only then start looking further

    #TODO linearly transform dynamics before 'poissoning'
